1.ÿÿÿ The users want to record and save all the data automatically once the program is started. A log file is required to run the program and data is saved at 1s intervals. (Jian: Is it possible to save the data in separate files everyday? For example, I have a measurement running and by the end of the day  I have a data file, and the new data will go to the file next day. If this is possible, we prefer this way and keep the data saving interval as 1s. If this is not possible, we will use the interval of 10s.);MFC 1-4;Flow rate / slpm / 0?.5;Pressure / bars / 0?5;Execute;27.01.2025;Soft + Test, 1h by device

2.ÿÿÿ The users want to change the feed gas composition by MFC-1-4. (Jian: To clearify, this sentence means that I want to set accurate values on MFC 1-4 so that they can mix and have a known composition. So no action needed for this request.);;;;;27.01.2025;Not fund such setup on V”gtlin devices
3.ÿÿÿ The users want to read the flow rate and set the upstream pressure by MFM-1. (Jian: The user wants to have a function of reading flowrate of a gas mixture);;;;;27.01.2025;
